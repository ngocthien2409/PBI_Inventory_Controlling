## 1. Introduction:

### 1.1 Overview of the company:

Adventure Works Cycles, a large, multinational manufacturing company, produces and distributes metal and composite bicycles to North American, European, and Asian commercial markets. While its base operation is located in Bothell, Washington, and employs 500 people, several regional sales teams are located throughout the company’s market region. In 2000, Adventure Works Cycles bought a small manufacturing plant, Wide World Importers, which is located in Mexico City, Mexico. Wide World Importers manufactures several critical subcomponents for the Adventure Works Cycles product line. These subcomponents are shipped to the Bothell location for final product assembly. In 2001, Wide World Importers became the sole  manufacturer and distributor of the touring bicycle product group. 

After a successful fiscal year, Adventure Works Cycles is looking to broaden its market share by focusing its sales efforts on the company’s best customers and reducing the cost of sales by reducing production costs.

The process starts with a production request, which is usually initiated by another process, such as delivery, which must complete a customer order (make-to-order strategy), or material preparation, which has decided that the company needs to raise inventory levels (make-to-stock strategy). The production department identified the following requirement want Data team support:
